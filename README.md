# Msm
msm: Minecraft Server Manager, its a Discord bot that allow you to manage a minecraft server.

## What is the objective of Msm?
well, basically msm was created for the people that want to host a local server but they dont want to deal with some type of zerotier/hamachi or exposing their pcs by opening ports.

## How Msm works?
Msm use a discord bot that allows you to control your server, it creates an ngrok tunnel so you dont expose your pc and ip, and let other users that you allow to interact with the server without having to have a website console of some sort of that stuff, just run a discord command and thats it, it just works.

## Philosophy
Msm was designed to be as minimal as possible, so plenty of users can make their own customization to the bot to edit it as they want, Basically like suckless software without being suckless software (any code optimization pull request will be acepted as long as they are minimalist). I will not add any primer functions to the main source code, but im going to leave a patches folder so you can patch the bot with the functions that you want, the patches pull requests are going to be more permissive since they will not be included in the source code.
